# Cosy Hotels (MVP Prototype)

An original boutique-hotel discovery prototype inspired by the general idea of curated hotel discovery (not copying content, design, or assets from any specific site).

- Static, no build tools required
- Home, Listings, and Hotel Detail pages
- Sample data only (in `assets/js/data.js`)

## Quick Start

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
- Serve the folder with any static server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server` from this folder) for clean URL/query param behavior.

## Notes

- All content here is original placeholder text and data.
- Replace sample data and images with your own sources or partner APIs.
- For production, consider a framework (Next.js/SvelteKit), a database, and a CMS.

## Next Steps (Suggested)

- Add real data sources (partner feeds/APIs) respecting ToS.
- Add user accounts, wishlists, and reviews.
- Add SEO-friendly pages with static generation.
- Integrate maps and neighborhood guides.
- Implement advanced filters and pagination.
